# Background

### Dyslipidemia in Children

\note{How prevalent is dyslipidemia?}




### Cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia

* Why is dyslipidemia important?
  - A risk factor for cardiovascular disease
  - contributes to the atherosclerotic process.
  
* Dyslipidemia affects xx proportion of the population with notable health disparities across racial/ethnic groups
    - Adverse lipid levels represent strong risk factors for mnay cardiovascular disease outcomes
    - Lipids are targets for intervention because they represent modifiable factors

### Disparities in Lipids

### Dyslipidemia can start in childhood

- How many have it in childhood?
- When you have it how likely are you to maintain dyslipidemia

### Early childhood determinants of chronic disesae

* Researchers have noted a wide range of chronic diseases linked to early life determinants.
    - Birthweight started as one widely noted early life determinant
    - Hypotheses have evolved and now include weight change over time in infancy: growth trajectories.

### Prior studies point towards association between postnatal growth and dyslipidemia later in life.

# Specific Aims

## Aims
### Aims

Overall:

  * Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
      - Contemporary Chilean birth cohort with monthly measures of weight in the first year of life
      - High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

  * Will investigate postnatal growth trajectories for weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.

## Aim 1
### Aim 1

Characterize growth trajectories for infants from 0 to 12 months and what are some significant predictors?

\smallskip

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim 1] Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life and replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.
\end{description}

\smallskip

We expect to replicate previous findings \footfullcite{Pizzi C, Cole TJ, Richiardi L, dos-Santos-Silva I, Corvalan C, De Stavola B. Prenatal Influences on Size, Velocity and Tempo of Infant Growth: Findings from Three Contemporary Cohorts. PLoS ONE. 2014 Feb 27;9(2):e90291.} indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as pre-pregnancy BMI, height and age with trajectory size.

2. Maternal education and trajectory velocity.


### Aim 2

Do certain postnatal growth trajectories associate with dyslipidemia?

\smallskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=Aim 2, leftmargin=*]
	\item Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and dyslipidemia.
\end{enumerate}

We expect:

Infants with faster growth trajectories will be more susceptible to dyslipidemia in adolescence.


### Aim 3

\begin{enumerate}[label=Question, leftmargin=*]
  \item Do growth trajectories modify the association between genetic variants related to lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia in adolescence?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=Aim 3, leftmargin=*]
	\item Assess gene-environment interaction between growth trajectory characteristics and genetic variants of lipid metabolism with dyslipidemia at 18 years of age as an outcome.
\end{enumerate}

We expect:

1. The selected genetic variants will associate with dyslipidemia in adolescence.
    
2. A gene-environment interaction exists in which extreme and less favorable growth characteristics will exhibit stronger, deleterious associations between the genetic variants and dyslipidemia.

# Approach

### Use SITAR\footfullcite{Beath KJ; Heller GZ.  Latent trajectory modelling of multivariate binary data. Statistical Modelling. 2009 Oct 21;9(3):199-213. Cole TJ; Donaldson MDC, Ben-Shlomo Y. SITAR -- a useful instrument for growth curve analysis. International Journal of Epidemiology. 2010 Jul 20;39(6):1558–66.} method to measure 3 types of postnatal growth: size, tempo, velocity

\note{SITAR: SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation}
\note{These methods are a novel approach to this area of research.}
