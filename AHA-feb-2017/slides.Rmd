# Background
## Background

### Definition of dyslipidemia for children [@de_Jesus_2011]

### Dyslipidemia levels in United States children [@nguyen_abnormal_2015]

### Cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia[@mozaffarian_heart_2015]

\note{It is clear that dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for CVD.

Dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease}

\note{Trends in mean serum total cholesterol among adolescents 12 to 19 years of age by race, sex, and survey year (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1988–1994, 1999–2006, and 2007–2012). Values are in mg/dL. Mex. Am. indicates Mexican American; and NH, non-Hispanic. Source: National Center for Health Statistics and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute}

### Dyslipidemia can start in childhood and track through adulthood

\note{xx maintain and track into childhood}

### Early childhood determinants of chronic disease

* Researchers have noted a wide range of chronic diseases linked to early life determinants.
    - Birthweight started as one widely noted early life determinant
    - Hypotheses have evolved and now include weight change over time in infancy: growth trajectories.

### Developmental Origins of Health and Disease[@hanson_early_2014] (DOoHAD)

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/hanson-fig1-small.png}

\note{This figure drives home the importance of intervention at an early age.

This figure also underlines the value in studying this period. Intervention, if possible, can have better returns in health promotion as well as being easier to implement than at later ages.}

### Prior observational studies point towards association between postnatal growth and dyslipidemia later in life.

### The postnatal period, a critical window where growth influences risk of chronic disease[@santos_early_2012]

\note{This idea fits within the developmental programming hypothesis.

- the key idea in this figure is that events occuring after birth can be subject to interventions which can alter the path to chronic disease.

- Just an example of what has been hypothesized as an intervention in xxxx}

# Specific Aims
## Specific Aims

### Aims

Overall:

  * Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
      - Contemporary Chilean birth cohort with monthly measures of weight in the first year of life
      - High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

  * Will investigate postnatal growth trajectories for weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.

## Aim 1
### Aim 1:  Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life

		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (meduc) to (exp);
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\note{Plan to replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.}

<!-- [@pizzi_prenatal_2014] -->


\note{We expect to replicate previous findings indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as pre-pregnancy BMI, height and age with trajectory size.

2. Maternal education and trajectory velocity.}

## Aim 2
### Aim 2: Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and dyslipidemia.

<!-- see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27279/how-to-make-an-arrow-bigger-and-change-its-color-in-tikz -->

\tikzset{
  big blue arrow/.style={
  line width=2pt,
    decoration={markings,mark=at position 1 with {\arrow[scale=2,blue]{>}}},
    postaction={decorate},
    shorten >=0.4pt}}

		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (1) to (2);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}


\note{Do certain postnatal growth trajectories associate with dyslipidemia?

We expect: Infants with faster growth trajectories will be more susceptible to dyslipidemia in adolescence.}

## Aim 3
### Aim 3: Assess interaction between growth and lipid metabolism genetic variants.

		\node[below=of 5](14){\begin{tabular}{c}lipid risk\\allele\end{tabular}};

		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (height) to (exp);
		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (parity) to (exp);
		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (meduc) to (exp);
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}




\note{Do growth trajectories modify the association between genetic variants related to lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia in adolescence?

We expect: 

1. The selected genetic variants will associate with dyslipidemia in adolescence.

2. A gene-environment interaction exists in which extreme and less favorable growth characteristics will exhibit stronger, deleterious associations between the genetic variants and dyslipidemia.}

# Approach
## Approach

### Use SITAR [@beath_infant_2007] method to measure 3 types of postnatal growth: size, tempo, velocity

\note{SITAR: SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation

These methods are a novel approach to this area of research.}

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/sim-growth-2.png}

### Use latent growth mixture models (LGMM) to determine patterns of growth

\note{
The figure on the left shows randomly generated growth curves for the first 12 months.

The figure on the right shows two distinct patterns of growth determined from the LGMM method.

In turn one can determine if these groups have different associations with dyslipidemia.

This second method is a different way of getting at the same question. Does growth influence dyslipidemia.}
