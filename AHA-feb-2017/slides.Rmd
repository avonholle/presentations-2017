# Background
## Background

### What is dyslipidemia? [@de_Jesus_2011]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{figures/expert-2011-table9-1.png}

\note{1. Will start with a definition. These values for plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels are from the NCEP Expert Panel on Cholesterol Levels in Children.

2. Thresholds for children different than adults.

3. Exceeding any of these categories results in a child being categorized as having dyslipidemia.
}

### Dyslipidemia patterns by socio-demographic characteristics in United States children [@nguyen_abnormal_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{figures/Nguyen-2015-fig4.png}

\note{1. Prevalence estimates here reflect differences across groups.}

### Racial/Ethnic lipid disparities in children exist

\vskip -0.3cm

Prevalence of Dyslipidemia in Children and Adolescents Aged 8 to 17 Years, 2011-2012[@kit_prevalence_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/kit-2015-t1.png}

\note{1. This figure provides more in-depth racial-ethnic disparities here.

2. Certain groups such as Hispanics are at higher risk of dyslipidemia in the general U.S. population and this is evident starting at young ages. (40-30 percent of Mexican men-women have high LDL vs 30-20 for NHW.)

2. All categories except TC show unfavorable levels of lipids for the Hispanic group.

3. These differences grow larger in the adult age group: over 50 percent of people in the Hispanic group have dyslipidemia and

- Want to note that recent estimates for children in the US average mean average TG is 79/83 in NHW/Mexican Americans. 

- TG is higher than both of these groups in the Chilean sample (88). 

- Average HDL in a recent US sample is 48 (for both NHW/MA). HDL is lower in the Chilean sample (40) (Burrows 2015).}


### Dyslipidemia is an established cardiovascular disease risk factor [@mozaffarian_heart_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.14]{figures/mozz-2008-fig1.png}

\note{1. Dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

2. So far I've noted dyslipidemia is prevalence and disparities exist for HL groups.

3. It's also an established risk factor for subsequent CVD.

4. This figure also shows that it can be modified in adults via diet and exercise.}


### Dyslipidemia tracks from early life to adulthood [@nuotio_adult_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{figures/Nuotio-2015-fig1.png}

\note{1. Once you have dyslipidemia it is more likely than not that you will continue to have dsylipidemia once you are an adult.

2. This figure shows increasing levels of unfavorable lipid levels as an adult the more times a child has been diagnosed with dyslipidemia.

3. To provide more concrete numbers here: A Finnish study with 27 years of tracking (juhola tracking 2011) indiciates that if you have high TC at age 18 the probability of having it as an adult is 63 percent for females and 84 percent for males.

4. Tracking dyslipidemia has value and it's important to evaluate and intervene early in life.}

### Early childhood determinants of chronic disease[@hanson_early_2014] 

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{figures/hanson-fig1-small.png}

\note{
- Dyslipidemia is prevalent and tracks in groups of children. This leaves the question of how to understand and prevent causes of disease: I am public health and this is a crucial part of epidemiology. Why is it important to modify this factor?

1. This figure further demonstrates the idea of tracking of risk from childhood and the importance in finding causes and linked interventions to reduce risk later in life.

2. Explain axes and transition from one trajectory to another upon an intervention in context of my dissertation.

3. My dissertation topic addresses how postnatal growth functions as an exposure of postnatal programming of lipid metabolism that may affect dyslipidemia.}


### Postnatal over-feeding (PNOF) represents a critical window influencing chronic disease risk[@habbout_postnatal_2013]


\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{figures/Habbout-2013-fig3-rev.png}

\note{
- Before any interventions can be done it is important to understand the cause of this risk factor.

1. This figure illustrates the idea that an event occuring early in life can impact disease later in life.

1. Animal studies provide the strongest evidence given the experimental design.

3. Faster growth either by type of diet or amount of food that ends with more adverse lipid levels later in life for the animals ranging from sheep to mice.}

### Prior observational studies point towards association between postnatal growth and dyslipidemia later in life.

# Specific Aims
## Specific Aims

### Aims

\Fonteighteen

* Overall

    - Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
    

    - Santiago Longitudinal Cohort Study (SLCS): Contemporary Chilean birth cohort

\note{1. Sample: SLCS has monthly measures of weight in the first year of life.

2. High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

3. Includes an understudied population bearing a large burden of cardiovascular disease.

4. Growth measures will include weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.}

## Aim 1
### Aim 1:  Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life

  big blue arrow/.style={
  line width=2pt,
    decoration={markings,mark=at position 1 with {\arrow[scale=2,blue]{>}}},

		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (parity) to (exp);
		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (meduc) to (exp);
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\note{Plan to replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.

This is a unique opportunity to replicate results in a similar cohort from the same city, Santiago, Chile.}

<!-- [@pizzi_prenatal_2014] -->


\note{We expect to replicate previous findings indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as 
- maternal height, 
- age and 
- education 
with velocity and size.

- In the original analyses height, age have a positive association with size (except education).

- Also, these three factors have a negative association with velocity.
}

## Aim 2
### Aim 2: Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and dyslipidemia.

<!-- see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27279/how-to-make-an-arrow-bigger-and-change-its-color-in-tikz -->

\tikzset{
  big blue arrow/.style={
  line width=2pt,
    decoration={markings,mark=at position 1 with {\arrow[scale=2,blue]{>}}},
    postaction={decorate},
    shorten >=0.4pt}}

\tikzset{
  red arrow/.style={
  line width=2pt,
    decoration={markings,mark=at position 1 with {\arrow[scale=2,red]{>}}},
    postaction={decorate},
    shorten >=0.4pt}}

		\node[right=of 1] (2) {\begin{tabular}{c}dyslipidemia, \\ 17 years \end{tabular}};
		\draw [->, red arrow] (1) to (2);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}


\note{1. The red arrow indicates the causal path of interest.

2. Question: Do certain postnatal growth trajectories associate with dyslipidemia?

3. We expect: Infants with faster growth trajectories will be more susceptible to dyslipidemia in adolescence.}

## Aim 3
### Aim 3: Assess lipid metabolism genetic variants as an effect modifier of growth and dyslipidemia relationship

		\draw [->, ba] (allele) to (outc);
		
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\note{-Question: Do growth trajectories modify the association between genetic variants related to lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia in adolescence?

- We expect: 

1. The selected genetic variants will associate with dyslipidemia in adolescence.

2. Certain genetic predispositions modify the association between growth and dyslipidemia. Extreme and less favorable growth characteristics will exhibit stronger, deleterious associations with dyslipidemia given certain genetics unique forms.}

# Approach
## Approach

### Use SITAR [@beath_infant_2007] method to measure 3 types of postnatal growth: size, tempo, velocity

\note{SITAR: SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation

- At this point I am going to review 2 methods I will use in the analysis, which present a novel approach to this area of research.

Describe each panel and what it means.}

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/sim-growth-2.png}

### Use latent growth mixture models (LGMM) to determine patterns of growth

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/sim-lgmm-2.png}

\note{
- Latent growth mixture models (LGMM) are the second approach I will use to search for patterns in growth and assess their association with dyslipidemia.

The figure on the left shows randomly generated growth curves for the first 12 months.

The figure on the right shows two distinct patterns of growth determined from the LGMM method.

In turn one can determine if these groups have different associations with dyslipidemia.

This second method is a different way of getting at the same question. Does growth influence dyslipidemia.}


# Conclusions
## Conclusions

<!--
### Strengths and Limitations

\Fonteighteen

* Strengths

    - Sample
  
    - Novel methods

* Limitations

    - Total effect vs indirect effects
    
\note{- There are arguments that early life exposures are over-stated and it is really later life exposures in the lifecourse that affect outcomes. }


### Public health impact: Interventions in the future

\Fonteighteen

- Interventions

    - Dietary changes
    
    - Supplements
    
    - Epigenetics
    
- More work needed
    
    

\note{

- Start by citing the Gustafsson 2010 paper. 

- This topic can lead into the importance of early life intervention even if there are mediating factors in the lifecourse, which may be more difficult to intervene upon.

- **Interventions** hold promise but are not clear: Feeding changes and supplements possible in first six months.

    - **Public health implications** of this work.

    - Should be clearly stated that there are no human studies with interventions. Literature is also very sparse.

      - More work is needed to understand the mechanism by which this process occurs before offering any solutions and/or interventions.

      - Although lipids were not studied one animal study in 2016 indicates caloric restriction can impact cvd risk factor programming. (Li 2016).

      - Other studies, from 2015 onwards suggest other approaches such as...

        - feeding Sohi 2015 and Breij 2014

        - fish oil supplement Li 2015

        - epigenetic Keating 2015

\end{figure}

\note{In this work I will be estimating the total effect of my exposure, child growth, on the outcome, dyslipidemia in adolescence. 

- However, what remains unexplained are the 

- indirect effects acting through child growth and

- direct effect of exposure unexplained by the mediators.

- An exploratory mediation analysis is of interest because some people advocate only intervention later, say in adolescence, but the size of these indirect and direct effects are not clear.

- This aim would address shortcomings in current work.}
