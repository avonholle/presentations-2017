# Background
## Background

### Dyslipidemia and lipid thresholds for children? [@de_Jesus_2011]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{figures/expert-2011-table9-1.png}

### Dyslipidemia patterns by socio-demographic characteristics in United States children [@nguyen_abnormal_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{figures/Nguyen-2015-fig4.png}

### Dyslipidemia is an established cardiovascular disease risk factor [@mozaffarian_heart_2015]

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.14]{figures/mozz-2008-fig1.png}

\note{It is clear that dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for CVD.

Dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease}


### Lipid Disparities: burden in African-American and Mexican-American children [@mozaffarian_heart_2015]

Trends in mean serum total cholesterol among adolescents 12 to 19 years of age by race, sex, and survey year

\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{figures/F28-large.jpg}


\note{Trends in mean serum total cholesterol among adolescents 12 to 19 years of age by race, sex, and survey year (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: 1988–1994, 1999–2006, and 2007–2012).

- Values are in mg/dL. 

- Mex. Am. indicates Mexican American; and NH, non-Hispanic. 

- Source: National Center for Health Statistics and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute}

### Dyslipidemia can start in childhood and track through adulthood

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.13]{figures/Nuotio-2015-fig1.png}

\note{Once you have dyslipidemia it is more likely than not that you will continue to have dsylipidemia once you are an adult.

- To provide more concrete numbers here: A Finnish study with 27 years of tracking (juhola tracking 2011) indiciates that if you have high TC at age 18 the probability of having it as an adult is 63 percent for females and 84 percent for males.}

### Early childhood determinants of chronic disease[@hanson_early_2014] 

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{figures/hanson-fig1-small.png}

\note{This figure drives home the importance of intervention at an early age.

This framework is nested in Developmental Origins of Health and Disease concept (DOoHAD)

This figure also underlines the value in studying this period. Intervention, if possible, can have better returns in health promotion as well as being easier to implement than at later ages.

* Researchers have noted a wide range of chronic diseases linked to early life determinants.

    - Birthweight started as one widely noted early life determinant.
    
    - This hypothesis started with Barker and is also known as Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOoHAD)

    - Hypotheses have evolved and now include weight change over time in infancy: growth trajectories.
}

### Prior observational studies point towards association between postnatal growth and dyslipidemia later in life.

### Postnatal over-feeding (POF) represents a critical window influencing chronic disease risk[@habbout_postnatal_2013]


\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{figures/Habbout-2013-fig3-rev.png}


\note{This idea fits within the developmental programming hypothesis.

- the key idea in this figure is that events occuring after birth can be subject to interventions which can alter the path to chronic disease.

- Just an example of what has been hypothesized as an intervention in xxxx

- TO DO: Mention results from other animal studies here.}

# Specific Aims
## Specific Aims

### Aims

Overall:

  * Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
      -  Santiago Longitudinal Cohort Study (SLCS): Contemporary Chilean birth cohort

  * Investigate postnatal growth trajectories for weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.

\note{SLCS has monthly measures of weight in the first year of life.

High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.}

## Aim 1
### Aim 1:  Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life

		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (parity) to (exp);
		\draw [->, big blue arrow] (meduc) to (exp);
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\note{Plan to replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.

This is a unique opportunity to replicate results in a similar cohort from the same city, Santiago, Chile.}

<!-- [@pizzi_prenatal_2014] -->


\note{We expect to replicate previous findings indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as 
- maternal height, 
- age and 
- education 
with velocity and size.

- In the original analyses height, age have a positive association with size (except education).

- Also, these three factors have a negative association with velocity.
}

## Aim 2
### Aim 2: Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and dyslipidemia.

		\draw [->, red arrow] (1) to (2);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	}


\note{The red arrow indicates the causal path of interest.

Question: Do certain postnatal growth trajectories associate with dyslipidemia?

We expect: Infants with faster growth trajectories will be more susceptible to dyslipidemia in adolescence.}

## Aim 3
### Aim 3: Assess interaction between growth and lipid metabolism genetic variants.

		\draw [->, ra] (exp) to (outc);
		
		\draw [->, ba] (allele) to (outc);
		
	\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{figure}

\note{-Question: Do growth trajectories modify the association between genetic variants related to lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia in adolescence?

- We expect: 

1. The selected genetic variants will associate with dyslipidemia in adolescence.

2. A gene-environment interaction exists in which extreme and less favorable growth characteristics will exhibit stronger, deleterious associations between the genetic variants and dyslipidemia.}

# Approach
## Approach

### Use SITAR [@beath_infant_2007] method to measure 3 types of postnatal growth: size, tempo, velocity

\note{SITAR: SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation

- At this point I am going to review 2 methods I will use in the analysis, which present a novel approach to this area of research.

Describe each panel and what it means.}

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/sim-growth-2.png}

### Use latent growth mixture models (LGMM) to determine patterns of growth

\note{
- Latent growth mixture models (LGMM) are the second approach I will use to search for patterns in growth and assess their association with dyslipidemia.

The figure on the left shows randomly generated growth curves for the first 12 months.

The figure on the right shows two distinct patterns of growth determined from the LGMM method.

In turn one can determine if these groups have different associations with dyslipidemia.

This second method is a different way of getting at the same question. Does growth influence dyslipidemia.}

# Conclusions
## Conclusions

### Strengths and Limitation

* Strengths

* Limitations

### Interventions hold promise but are not clear.

- Change postnatal environment to reduce postnatal overfeeding?

\note{Now I will discuss the public health implications of this work.

- Should be clearly stated that there are no human studies of this concept.

- Literature is also very sparse.

- More work is needed to understand the mechanism by which this process occurs before offering any solutions and/or interventions.

- Although lipids were not studied one animal study in 2016 indicates caloric restriction can impact cvd risk factor programming. (Li 2016)

\end{figure}

\note{In this work I will be estimating the total effect of my exposure, child growth, on the outcome, dyslipidemia in adolescence. 

- However, what remains unexplained are the 

- indirect effects acting through child growth and

- direct effect of exposure unexplained by the mediators.

- An exploratory mediation analysis is of interest because some people advocate only intervention later, say in adolescence, but the size of these indirect and direct effects are not clear.}
