## Postnatal growth and lipids
### Postnatal growth and lipids

\begin{itemize}
	\item Repeated animal and human studies have shown that postnatal growth is associated with the later development of dyslipidemia.

## Postnatal growth as an environmental cue
### Postnatal growth as an environmental cue

* The postnatal period is a critical window of time in which accelerated growth can influence risk of chronic disease later in life: developmental programming hypothesis

# Specific Aims

## Aims
### Aims

* Overall:

  * Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
      - Contemporary Chilean birth cohort with monthly measures of weight in the first year of life
      - High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

  * Will investigate postnatal growth trajectories for weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.


##Aim 1
### Aim 1

What do growth trajectories look like for infants from 0 to 12 months and what are some significant predictors?

\smallskip

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim 1] Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life and replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.
\end{description}

\smallskip

We expect to replicate previous findings \footfullcite{Pizzi C, Cole TJ, Richiardi L, dos-Santos-Silva I, Corvalan C, De Stavola B. Prenatal Influences on Size, Velocity and Tempo of Infant Growth: Findings from Three Contemporary Cohorts. PLoS ONE. 2014 Feb 27;9(2):e90291.} indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as pre-pregnancy BMI, height and age with trajectory size.

2. Maternal education and trajectory velocity.


### Aim 2

Are there any specific types of postnatal growth trajectories associated with dyslipidemia?

\smallskip

\begin{enumerate}[label=Aim 2, leftmargin=*]
	\item Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and dyslipidemia.
\end{enumerate}

* Based on prior evidence we expect:

1. Infants with steeper growth trajectories more susceptible to dyslipidemia in adolescence.

2. Males will show a stronger association between size, tempo and velocity measures than females.



### Aim 3

Do growth trajectories modify the association between genetic variants related to lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia in adolescence?

\begin{enumerate}[label=Aim 3, leftmargin=*]
	\item Assess gene-environment interaction between growth trajectory characteristics and genetic variants of lipid metabolism with dyslipidemia at 18 years of age as an outcome.
\end{enumerate}

* We expect:

    1. The selected genetic variants will associate with dyslipidemia in adolescence.
    
    2. A gene-environment interaction exists in which extreme and less favorable growth characteristics will exhibit stronger, deleterious associations between the genetic variants and dyslipidemia.

# Approach

## SITAR method
### SITAR method

SITAR: SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation \footfullcite{Beath KJ; Heller GZ.  Latent trajectory modelling of multivariate binary data. Statistical Modelling. 2009 Oct 21;9(3):199-213. Cole TJ; Donaldson MDC, Ben-Shlomo Y. SITAR -- a useful instrument for growth curve analysis. International Journal of Epidemiology. 2010 Jul 20;39(6):1558â€“66.}.

\smallskip
Use SITAR to measure three measures of postnatal growth: size, tempo and velocity.
