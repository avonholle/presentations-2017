## Postnatal growth and lipids
### Postnatal growth and lipids

\begin{itemize}
	\item Repeated animal and human studies have shown that postnatal growth is associated with the later development of adverse cardiovascular risk factors like low HDL-C levels.

# Specific Aims

## Aims
### Aims

Overall:
- Investigate the association between postnatal growth trajectories and lipids in adolescence
    - Contemporary Chilean birth cohort with monthly measures of weight in the first year of life
    - High quality clinical measures of cardiovascular disease risk factors.

- Will investigate postnatal growth trajectories for weight-for-length, weight and length outcome measures.


##Aim 1
### Aim 1

What do growth trajectories look like for infants from 0 to 12 months and what are some significant predictors?

\smallskip

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim 1] Characterize individual growth trajectories in the first year of life and replicate predictors of growth using external validation with an independent sample.
\end{description}

\smallskip

We expect to replicate previous findings \footfullcite{Pizzi C, Cole TJ, Richiardi L, dos-Santos-Silva I, Corvalan C, De Stavola B. Prenatal Influences on Size, Velocity and Tempo of Infant Growth: Findings from Three Contemporary Cohorts. PLoS ONE. 2014 Feb 27;9(2):e90291.} indicating a positive association between:

1. Maternal characteristics such as pre-pregnancy BMI, height and age with trajectory size.

2. Maternal education and trajectory velocity.


### Aim 2

Are there any specific types of postnatal growth trajectories associated with dyslipidemia?

\smallskip

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim 2] Examine the association between postnatal growth trajectories and HDL-C levels.
\end{description}

Based on prior evidence we expect

1. Infants with steeper growth trajectories to associate with adverse HDL-C levels in adolescence.

2. Males will show a stronger association between size, tempo and velocity measures than females.

Example of their explanation for slide structure in markdown compared to LaTex:

# This is my section
## This is my subsection
### Title of a slide

*Hi mom!*

is the same as

\section{This is my section}

\frame{
\frametitle{Title of a slide}

\textit{Hi mom!}
